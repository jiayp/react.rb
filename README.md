It lets you write reactive UI components, with Ruby's elegance using the tried
and true React.js engine. :heart:

### Important: current `react.rb` gem users please [read this!](#road-map)

## Installation 

Install the gem, or load the js library

+ add `gem 'reactive-ruby'` to your gem file or
+ `gem install reactive-ruby` or
+ install (or load via cdn) [inline-reactive-ruby.js](http://github.com/reactive-ruby/inline-reactive-ruby)

For gem installation it is highly recommended to read [the getting started section at reactrb.org](http://reactrb.org/docs/getting-started.html)

## Quick Overview

React.rb components are ruby classes that inherit from `React::Component::Base` or include `React::Component`.

`React::Component` provides a complete DSL to generate html and event handlers, and has full set of class macros to define states, parameters, and lifecycle callbacks.

Each react component class has a render method that generates the markup for that component.

Each react component class defines a new tag-method in the DSL that works just like built-in html tags, so react components can render other react components.

As events occur, components update their state, which causes them to rerender, and perhaps pass new parameters to lower level components, thus causing them to rerender.  

Under the hood the actual work is effeciently done by the [React.js](http://facebook.github.io/react/) engine. 

React.rb components are *isomorphic* meaning they can run on the server as well as the client.  This means that the initial expansion of the component tree to markup is done server side, just like ERB, or HAML templates.   Then the same code runs on the client and will respond to any events.   

React.rb integrates well with Rails, Sinatra, and simple static sites, and can be added to existing web pages very easily, or it can be used to deliver complete websites.

## Why ?

+ *Single Language:*  Use Ruby everywhere, no JS, markup languages, or JSX
+ *Powerful DSL:* Describe HTML and event handlers with a minimum of fuss
+ *Ruby Goodness:* Use all the features of Ruby to create reusable, maintainable UI code
+ *React Simplicity:* Nothing is taken away from the React.js model
+ *Enhanced Features:* Enhanced parameter and state management and other new features
+ *Plays well with Others:* Works with other frameworks, React.js components, Rails, Sinatra and static web pages

# Road Map

The original `react.rb` gem is still available as the [0-3-stable branch.](https://github.com/zetachang/react.rb/tree/0-3-stable) **but please read on..**

Many new features, bug fixes, and improvements are incoporated in the `reactive-ruby` gem currently built on the [0-7-stable branch.](https://github.com/zetachang/react.rb/tree/0-7-stable)  In addtion more extensive documentation for the current stable branch  is available at [reactrb.org](http://reactrb.org), and the [Opal Ruby Playground](http://fkchang.github.io/opal-playground/?code:&html_code=%3Cdiv%20id%3D%22container%22%3E%3C%2Fdiv%3E%0A&css_code=body%20%7B%0A%20%20background%3A%20%23eeeeee%3B%0A%7D%0A) incorporates the current stable branch.

Our plan is to do one more upgrade on the `reactive-ruby` gem which will be designated version 0.8.0. [click for detailed feature list](https://github.com/zetachang/react.rb/milestones/0.8.x)

From 0.9.0 and beyond we will return to using the `react.rb` gem for releases, and `reactive-ruby` will continue as a meta gem that depends only on react.rb >= 0.9.x.

Version 0.9.0 of `react.rb` **will not be** 100% backward compatible with 0.3.0 so its very important to begin your upgrade process now by switching to `reactive-ruby` 0.7.0.

Please let us know either at [Gitter.im](https://gitter.im/zetachang/react.rb) or [via an issue](https://github.com/zetachang/react.rb/issues) if you have specific concerns with the upgrade from 0.3.0 to 0.9.0.

## Developing

`git clone` the project.

To play with some live examples cd to the project directory then 

2. `cd example/examples`
2. `bundle install`
3. `bundle exec rackup`
4. Open `http://localhos:9292`

or 

1. `cd example/rails-tutorial`
2. `bundle install`
3. `bundle exec rails s`
4. Open `http://localhost:3000`

or

1. `cd example/sinatra-tutorial`
2. `bundle install`
3. `bundle exec rackup`
4. Open `http://localhost:9292`

Note that these are very simple examples, for the purpose of showing how to configure the gem in various server environments.  For more  examples and information see [reactrb.org.](http://reactrb.org)

## Testing

1. Run `bundle exec rake test_app` to generate a dummy test app.
2. `bundle exec rake`
